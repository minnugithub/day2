            <p>Early fans of Johanna Ortiz will remember her breakthrough piece in 2015: an off-the-shoulder, puffed-sleeve, sold-out-everywhere striped shirt called the Tulum Top. Her brand has come a long way since then, aesthetically and business-wise. The top’s mix of familiarity and Latin flair has trickled out into tailoring, evening dresses, jewelry, and shoes, and nearly everything is made in Ortiz’s vertically-integrated atelier in Cali, Colombia. </p>

            <p>Mikati’s an optimist at heart, she dreams big, and she’s got energy to burn. At the moment, the artist Javier Calleja has carte blanche to draw on the walls in her London boutique in time for Frieze (he also lent his little characters’ pie-eyes to some of Mikati’s knits). Come spring, the artist Gabriela Noelle—whom Mikati met in Miami—will layer in whimsical flowers, reprised here in prints, on lucite brooche </p>

            <p> Like so many designers, Mira Mikati has had to pivot in ways she never dreamed possible: Covid times forced her to put her brand-new London boutique on hold and get up to speed online. But if it put the breaks on travel, it didn’t stop her from putting together a book entitled Colorful World, a collection of personal photos chronicling 50 favorite travel destinations, from Paris and Provence to Argentina, Tokyo, Sicily, and South Africa.</p>
